**Python toolkit for geostatistical simulation of daily rainfall fields**

This repository contains the code accompanying the publication:  
**_‚ÄúGeostatistical Simulation of Daily Rainfall Fields ‚Äì Performance Assessment for Extremes in West Africa‚Äù_**  
‚Üí [DOI: 10.1175/JHM-D-23-0123.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-23-0123.1)

The toolkit provides functionality for geostatistical simulation of daily rainfall, with a particular focus on modeling extremes under data-scarce conditions, such as those encountered in parts of West Africa.

### üîß **Features**
- Geostatistical simulation of daily rainfall fields with multiple realizations  
- Probabilistic approaches to assess and model extreme precipitation events  
---

### üìÇ **Examples**
The `example/` folder contains reproducible scripts demonstrating:
- Data preprocessing and input formatting  
- Execution of the geostatistical simulation in a conditional mode (conditional_simulation.py) and uncondtional mode (unconditional_simulation.py)
- Visualization of simulation results

### üåç **Context**
This toolkit was developed within the BMBF-funded **FURIFLOOD** project. It is intended for researchers and practitioners in the fields of environmental data science, hydrology, and climate modeling.
